## About Me

Hello! I'm **rat-ware**. 

At the time of writing, I'm a developer in Cyber Threat Intelligence by day, and a hobbyist malware analyst by night.

By making this blog, I'm hoping to document my journey into malware analysis & reverse engineering, and all ups & downs I face along the way. I'll do my best to share useful learning resources, malware analysis reports, and anything else I find interesting :(fas fa-face-grin-beam fa-fw):
